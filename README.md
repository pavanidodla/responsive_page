# Task 4: Make a Website Mobile-Friendly Using CSS Media Queries

## Objective
Convert an existing desktop-only web page to a responsive, mobile-friendly layout by using CSS media queries.

---

## Tools Used
- Any existing HTML file (e.g., `index.html`)
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for editing
- Google Chrome with DevTools for testing responsiveness

---

## Steps Taken

1. **Open the HTML file in VS Code**  
   Loaded the existing desktop-only page for editing.

2. **Identify fixed-width elements or large images**  
   Checked for elements with fixed widths or images that donâ€™t scale on smaller screens.

3. **Write media queries targeting devices with max-width 768px**  
   Applied CSS media queries to adjust styles for tablets and mobile devices.

4. **Adjust layout for smaller screens**  
   - Stacked multi-column layouts vertically (e.g., cards and navigation links).  
   - Reduced font sizes for better readability.  
   - Adjusted paddings and margins to avoid cramped layouts.

5. **Make navigation menu responsive**  
   - Changed horizontal navigation links to stack vertically on small screens.  
   - Ensured menu is easy to tap and navigate on mobile devices.

6. **Test responsiveness using Chrome DevTools device toolbar**  
   - Simulated multiple device viewports (mobile, tablet).  
   - Verified smooth layout transitions and no horizontal scrolling.

7. **Fix overflow and scrolling issues**  
   - Ensured no content causes horizontal scrollbars on small screens.  
   - Made images and other elements scale within their containers.

8. **Ensure images are responsive**  
   - Used CSS properties like `max-width: 100%;` and `height: auto;` for images.
